# Power-BI-Project_Hotel-Revenue
Data Analyst Project: Hotel Revenue Analysis
This project aims to analyze hotel revenue using data analysis techniques and visualizations to answer key questions from stakeholders. The project follows the following steps:

Building a Database: The first step involves building a database to store relevant data, such as hotel revenue, parking lot size, and other relevant information. The database is designed to efficiently store and organize data for analysis.

Developing SQL Queries: Next, SQL queries are developed to extract and manipulate data from the database. These queries are optimized to retrieve the necessary information for the analysis and answer the specific questions from stakeholders.

Connecting Power BI to Database: Power BI, a powerful data visualization tool, is then connected to the database to visualize the data. Power BI allows for interactive and dynamic visualizations that can be customized to provide meaningful insights.

Visualizing Data: Data is visualized using Power BI to provide clear and concise insights for stakeholders. Visualizations such as line charts, bar charts, and heatmaps are utilized to showcase trends, patterns, and relationships in the data.

The project aims to answer key questions from stakeholders, such as:

Is our hotel revenue growing by year? By analyzing revenue data over time, the project provides insights into revenue trends and growth patterns, allowing stakeholders to make informed decisions.

Should we increase our parking lot size? The project analyzes parking lot size data and its impact on revenue to provide insights into whether increasing the parking lot size would be beneficial for the hotel.

What trends can we see in the data? The project identifies trends, patterns, and correlations in the data, providing stakeholders with valuable insights that can inform business strategies.
